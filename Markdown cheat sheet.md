# This is a h1

### This is a h3
Use Hash # to create headings in mark down followed by a space

### paragraphs

Use a blank line to separate paragraphs

like this!

This is a new paragraph.
Where as this
is not.

### Line break

To create a line break, use trailing  white space e.g. 2 spaces then return. or the HTML  tag br tag.<br>

For best practice and visibility, use the br tag as it is difficult to see trailing white spaces and many people naturally put 2 spaces after each sentences causing unintentional line breaks.<br>

 
#### Bold text

 

Use 2 asterisk or 2 underscores to bold text.

This is **bold**

This is also __bold__

 

**B**old.

Best practice is to use asterisks in the middle of a word as some markdown applications do not know how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. 

 

### Italics

 

Use 1 asterisk or underscore to italicise a word.

For example <br>

*This sentence is in italics.*

The word is in _italics_

 

Similar to making text bold, best practice is to use asterisk if you want to italicise the middle of a word.

Thisis*Italics*.

 

#### Using bold and italics together

use 3 asterisks to make a word both **bold** and *italic*

***This is both bold and Italic***

### Blockquotes

> this is a block quote

put in a > sign in the beginning to create a block quote

>For multiple paragraphs, put the > sign at the start of each line.
>
>This will create a bigger block quote
>
>to fit everything.

>Block quotes can also 
>>be nested by adding another > on
>
> the paragraph to be nested

### Ordered Lists
Lists can be created by putting a number followed by a fullstop.  The number can be any number but the first list item should start with 1. and following items will increment by 1.

1.  First list item
2.  Second list item
3.  Third list item

is the same as:

1.  First list item
99.  Second list item
0.  Third list item

Starting with 3, the next items become 4 and 5 for example:

3.  First list item
2.  Second list item
3.  Third list item
