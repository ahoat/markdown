Use Hash # to create headings in mark down followed by a space

### paragraphs

Use a blank line to separate paragraphs

like this!

This is a new paragraph.
Where as this
is not.

### Line break

To create a line break, use trailing  white space e.g. 2 spaces then return. or the HTML  tag br tag.<br>

For best practice and visibility, use the br tag as it is difficult to see trailing white spaces and many people naturally put 2 spaces after each sentences causing unintentional line breaks.<br>

 
#### Bold text

 

Use 2 asterisk or 2 underscores to bold text.

This is **bold**

This is also __bold__

 

**B**old.

Best practice is to use asterisks in the middle of a word as some markdown applications do not know how to handle underscores in the middle of a word. 

 

### Italics

 

Use 1 asterisk or underscore to italicise a word.

For example <br>

*This sentence is in italics.*

The word is in _italics_

 

Similar to making text bold, best practice is to use asterisk if you want to italicise the middle of a word.

Thisis*Italics*.

 

#### Using bold and italics together

use 3 asterisks to make a word both **bold** and *italic*

***This is both bold and Italic***
